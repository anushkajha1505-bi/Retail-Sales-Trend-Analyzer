# Retail-Sales-Trend-Analyzer
 Built an end-to-end data analysis pipeline on a 50,000+ row retail transactions dataset to identify sales trends, seasonal patterns, and underperforming product categories. • Performed full EDA including null handling, outlier detection, and feature engineering; reduced data inconsistencies by 30% through systematic cleaning. 
# Retail Sales Trend Analyzer

A complete end-to-end data analysis project built to explore sales patterns, seasonal trends, and product performance from a retail transactions dataset. This was built as a portfolio project to practice real-world EDA, SQL querying, and visual storytelling.

## Problem Statement

Retail businesses generate massive amounts of transactional data but often struggle to extract meaningful insights from it. The goal of this project was to answer key business questions:

- Which product categories drive the most revenue?
- Are there seasonal patterns in sales volume?
- Which regions consistently underperform?
- How effective are discount strategies in driving volume vs. margin?

## Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle - Superstore Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)  
**Rows:** ~10,000 transactions  
**Columns include:** Order Date, Category, Sub-Category, Region, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit

> If you want to use it locally, download from the link above and place it in `data/raw/retail_transactions.csv`.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- pip
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anu-1505/retail-sales-analysis.git
cd retail-sales-analysis

# 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

Then open notebooks in the order: `01 → 02 → 03 → 04`

---

## Requirements

```
pandas==2.1.4
numpy==1.26.3
matplotlib==3.8.2
seaborn==0.13.1
jupyter==1.0.0
openpyxl==3.1.2
```

(Save this as `requirements.txt` in root folder)

## Key Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning (`01_data_cleaning.ipynb`)
- Identified and handled ~30% missing values in the `Postal Code` column
- Removed 47 duplicate order entries
- Standardized date formats and extracted Year, Month, Quarter features
- Capped outliers in `Sales` column using IQR method

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (`02_exploratory_analysis.ipynb`)
- Distribution plots for Sales, Profit, Discount
- Correlation heatmap — discovered negative correlation between high discounts and profit
- Category-level box plots showing Technology as the highest-margin category

### 3. Sales Trends (`03_sales_trends.ipynb`)
- Monthly time-series showing Q4 (Oct–Dec) as peak sales period every year
- Regional bar charts — West region leads, Central region trails
- Sub-category breakdown — Phones and Chairs are top revenue drivers

### 4. SQL Queries (`sql_queries/`)
All queries are written to work on SQLite. Load `retail_cleaned.csv` into SQLite using:
```python
import pandas as pd, sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('sales.db')
df = pd.read_csv('data/cleaned/retail_cleaned.csv')
df.to_sql('sales', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```
Then run queries from the `sql_queries/` folder directly.

## Key Insights

1. **Q4 consistently accounts for ~35% of annual revenue** — discount campaigns should be concentrated here
2. **High discount rates (>30%) actually reduce profit margins** — discount strategy needs restructuring
3. **Central region underperforms** despite similar order volumes — logistics or pricing issue
4. **Technology category has the highest profit per unit** — worth prioritizing in marketing spend
5. **Tables sub-category operates at a net loss** — candidate for discontinuation or repricing

---

## Sample Visualizations

All charts are saved in `outputs/charts/`. Key ones include:
- `monthly_sales_trend.png` — 3-year sales line chart
- `category_profit_heatmap.png` — profit by category × region
- `discount_vs_profit_scatter.png` — shows the discount-profit inverse relationship
